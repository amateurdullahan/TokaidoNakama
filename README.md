<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://amateurdullahan.github.io/TokaidoNakama/)

**Tokaido Nakama** assists users with tracking their player score, coin count, and all probabilities while playing the board game Tokaido.  This project was designed by [Robert Rowe](https://github.com/robertrowe1013), with back-end programming by [Dylan Carey](https://github.com/amateurdullahan), and the front-end programming by [Corbin Enterline](https://github.com/corbinenterline1). This application was created as a final project for the Foundations year at Holberton School.  The inspiration was something in the board game space that had not been done before, that would also showcase our skills and help shape our interests in game design.


### Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news)
* [Pygame-menu](https://github.com/ppizarror/pygame-menu)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.


### Installation

1.
Option A - Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/amateurdullahan/TokaidoNakama.git
```
**or**

Option B - Download and extract the ZIP


2. Run **screen.pyw**


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To begin, click on **screen.py** to launch the application.

You will be greeted with the player selection. Currently the app only supports 3 players (2 & 4-5 are coming). You select the players in order of starting turns.

From there the application will indicate at the top of the screen which player's turn it is. Click on the appropriate board space to select any action(s) pertaining to that space, if any. The app will automatically move the player piece, and update all scores/coins/probabilities as needed. Automagic!



<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

* Player Count (2, 4-5): Neutral traveller needs to be implemented for 2 player games, the expanded spaces need to be coded for 4 and 5 players.
* Achievement Tracking: Most of the functionality has been coded and commented out. Temple bonus doesn't track properly, also want to include an option to either have the acheivements updated each turn and included in the current score or to not include the acheivement points until the final score. 
* Expansions: Additional traveler and encounter card promos, the mitsuri cards for the inn spaces, and the Crossroads alternate actions for each space.
* Rule Variations: Add in traveler tile abilities, Return Trip and Gastronomy variants, and alternate starting money for Preperations.
